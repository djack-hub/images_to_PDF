# images_to_PDF

This is a Python program that simply takes several image files and combines them into 1 PDF file. When run, the newly generated PDF file is added to the existing folder. 

Inspiration for this project came from this source: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/convert-multiple-images-into-a-single-pdf-file-with-python/
